# Tic Tac Toe Game
 This is Tic Tae Toe Game developed on Java.

 This is the Tic Tac Toe Game (also known as sea chess). The project is written in Java, being console app based without GUI and etc. In it I have mainly emphasized over logic to apply my knowledge so far in Java. In the application it will be possible to print the "board" on which the game will be played and take the input of the player and put it in the right place. We have computer opponent, who makes simple “moves”. Also the app can check if the game is over and who is the winner or if the “board” is full and no one wins (we have tie).

 # How to play?

 The first player starts by choosing a position from 1 to 9 (the positions represent a number from the board on which sea chess is played, and accordingly it is divided into 9 pieces). The number chosen by the player, if it is valid (for a number to be valid, the piece of the board with this number must be empty) is marked X. In case of invalid selection of a number (the number is different from 1 to 9 or (X or O is already placed on the same number) the player must make a new number selection. The computer you are playing against is built on a similar principle, as it chooses a random number from 1 to 9 and checks whether the place it has chosen is valid or not. In case the place is valid, the computer places the sign O. The player can end in several options: The first option is that the player has won. The second option is that the computer has won, and the last option is that we have a tie.
