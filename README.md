# Tic Tac Toe Game
 This is Tic Tae Toe Game developed on Java.

 This is the Tic Tac Toe Game (also known as sea chess). The project is written in Java, being console app based without GUI and etc. In it I have mainly emphasized over logic to apply my knowledge so far in Java. In the application it will be possible to print the "board" on which the game will be played and take the input of the player and put it in the right place. We have computer opponent, who makes simple “moves”. Also the app can check if the game is over and who is the winner or if the “board” is full and no one wins (we have tie).
